# Description
This is the server component of the Nines application. It provides a RESTful web API for viewing request response information and errors

At this time, this should be installed on the same machine that hosts the Httpinger component.

Httpinger makes the actual HTTP requests and logs the results. This component provides a RESTful API view of the results.
